/**
 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its
 * thickness should be constant; however, it should have different heights in different places. The
 * height of the wall is specified by an array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the
 * wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the
 * wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
 * <p>
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are
 * rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] H); }
 * <p>
 * that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, returns the
 * minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
 * <p>
 * For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
 * <p>
 * H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
 * H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
 * H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
 * the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 * each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
